# Last fm stats viewer

Trying out lastfm [api](https://www.last.fm/api#getting-started) and Svelte kit

Simply request my most listen albums and display

## Requirement

Latest version of nodejs and npm

## Install

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
cp .env.example .env
```
Get an lastfm API key at https://www.last.fm/api/account/create and parse it to the .env file

## Potentiel TODO to try
- Ask which last fm user to fetch the informations at the beggining (instead of just search mine)
- Display most listen music tag
- Display most listen artists
- Link of the Spotify and/or lastfm page of the albums/artists
